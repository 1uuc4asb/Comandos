continuing with the core utilities..

cat /path/file                                               # Show file contents
strings                                                      # Show printable characters in binary files ( Really, i think i'll never use that. Only time can tell )
find ~ -name file's-name                                     # Search for a file ( VERY USEFUL )
df -h                                                        # Show remaining space on all partitions
ps -A                                                        # Show all running processes
killall process                                              # Kill all running instances of a process

IMPORTANT TO KNOW: in "~/path/file", for example," ~ " means the personal folder.
                   in " ls *.mkv ", for example, " * " # is a regular expression that means something like "ALL". 
                                                      #in this particular case, the therminal will list all mkv files.

chown (you user for example) (file)                          # Change Owner of a file(VERY IMPORTANT)
EXAMPLE: sudo chown lucas /path/cu.html                      #
You can also, change the group.
EXAMPLE: sudo chown lucas:users /path/file                   # Change Owner and group of a file

ls -l /path                                                  # List files and display metadata (VERY IMPORTANT)

Explanation: ls -l displays 
respectively:
- type and permissions
- number of hard links 
- owner user name
- group name 
- size
- last modification
- entilty name

The first character is the type.
"d" means directory
"-" means file
"p" means named pipe (aka FIFO) # idk what it is but, is this.
"l" means link

after the type comes permissions
2° character tells if is readable or not. 

r means readable //// - means non readable.

3° tells if is writable, that is, if can be modified. 

w writable //// - non writable

...........
There are 3 columns. 
The first represents the owner permissions, second the group permissions and the last represents all users.
