continuing with the core utilities..

cat /path/file              # Show file contents
strings                     # Show printable characters in binary files ( Really, i think i'll never use that. Only time can tell )
find ~ -name file's-name    # Search for a file ( VERY USEFUL )
df -h                       # Show remaining space on all partitions
ps -A                       # Show all running processes
killall process             # Kill all running instances of a process

IMPORTANT TO KNOW: in "~/path/file", for example," ~ " means the personal folder.
                   in " ls *.mkv ", for example, " * " # is a regular expression that means something like "ALL". 
                                                      #in this particular case, the therminal will list all mkv files.
